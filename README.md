# Twitter-Project 
supervised machine learning - classification

This project has two parts! 
The first part was creating a system to predict whether a tweet will go viral or not via K-Neighbors Classifier.
I used the tweet length, follower count, and friend count as features that I think would contribute to a tweet going viral. Accuracy: ~0.62.
Second part was creating a system to predict where a tweet was sent from between three cities: New York, London, and Paris via Naive Bayes Classifier method.
I used the text/tweet itself because it may contain the language and some landmarks. Accuracy: ~0.68.

#todo revisit to create a better models and add more features possibly
